Wow. This is great. This is fantastic. A very, very special hello to Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania. I went to school in
Pennsylvania. I know everything about Pennsylvania. I love Pennsylvania. I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible -- and it is incredible. Is it incredible? This incredible commonwealth with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots and hard hats.

People have no idea how smart they are. Their greatest -- these are great people, let me tell you. I love them. I'd like to
begin by asking a very, very simple and easy to understand question. [Audience member calls out "Yes"] Are you better off now than you were four years ago? [Audience responds "No"] Does anybody disagree? It's dangerous.

Donald Trump 00:01:11-00:01:41 (31 sec)	NO SIGNAL (0.267)
?
Don't do it. But over the past four years, Americans have suffered one catastrophic failure, betrayal, and humiliation
after another. Kamala Harris has delivered soaring prices and economic anguish at home, war and chaos abroad [Audience boos] and nation-destroying invasion on our southern border like nobody's ever seen before.

Donald Trump 00:01:41-00:02:13 (32 sec)	NO SIGNAL (0.379)
?
She's actually a disaster. [Audience member calls out "Yeah"] My message to Americans tonight is simple: We do not
have to live this way. We don't. We don't. And we won't. We won't. We do not have to settle for weakness, incompetence, decline, and decay. With your vote tomorrow, we can fix every single problem our country faces and lead America and, indeed, the whole world to new heights of glory.

Donald Trump 00:02:13-00:02:42 (29 sec)	NO STRESSLENS
?
We will help the world. A lot of people think we're isolationists. We're not. But we want -- but we want the world to
appreciate what we're doing. They have to appreciate that we're helping them. When we win election -- only one day. How does that sound? Nice. One day from [Audio gap] senators and congressmen.

Donald Trump 00:02:42-00:03:29 (47 sec)	NO STRESSLENS
?
We've been waiting four years. Oh, now, it's what I've been saying, only one year [Audio gap] four years for this, four
[Audio gap] you know, we totally rebuilt our military. But now, it needs a little strengthening after giving a big chunk of it to Afghanistan. Figure that out. [Audience boos] Figure that one out.

Donald Trump 00:03:29-00:03:48 (19 sec)	NO SIGNAL (0.004)
?
I will restore peace in the world, and I will rescue the American dream. Together, we will begin the four greatest years in
the history of our country and we will launch the most extraordinary economic boom the world has ever seen. And we'll do it by utilizing the assets that we have. If you vote for Kamala [Audience boos] you will have four more years of misery, failure, and disaster.

Donald Trump 00:03:48-00:04:11 (23 sec)	NO SIGNAL (0.487)
?
Our country may never recover. Vote for me and I will deliver rising wages, soaring income, and a colossal surge of jobs,	X
wealth, and opportunity for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed, every one of them. [Audience member calls out "Yeah"] A vote for Trump means your groceries will be cheaper.

?	Donald Trump 00:04:11-00:04:30 (20 sec)	NO SIGNAL (0.364)

So many people mentioned -- I go in, so many people mention groceries, that beautiful but simple word, groceries. "Sir, my groceries." You don't think of it that way, but that's what they mentioned more than anything, my groceries. Your paychecks will be higher, your streets will be safer and cleaner, your communities will be richer, and your future will be brighter than ever before.


Donald Trump 00:04:30-00:04:44 (13 sec)
?
This will be the golden age of America. Just a few months ago, in a beautiful field in Pennsylvania, not far from where we
are tonight, an assassin tried to stop our movement. [Audience boos] And this is the greatest political movement by far in the history of our country. Tried to stop it. But that brush with death did not stop us.


Donald Trump 00:04:44-00:05:11 (27 sec)
?
It only made us more determined to finish the job that we had only just started. [Audience chants "Fight"] Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you very much. This is a frisky group. Many people say that God saved me in order to save America. Many, many people are saying that. And with your help, we will fulfill that extraordinary mission together.


Donald Trump 00:05:11-00:05:33 (22 sec)
?
We're going to fulfill it. We're going to save our country. But many, many people have said that. To every citizen across
this land, I am asking for the honor of your vote. I don't want your money. I don't want anything. I just want your vote. We are -- we are on the five-yard line. I would actually say we're on the one-yard line, if you want to really know the truth.


Donald Trump 00:05:33-00:06:10 (38 sec)
?
And some of the -- some of the -- oh, that's a lot of fake news back there. Look at that. [Audience boos] You know, for a
person that they hate, they sure do show up, right? There. That's a big group of people. Some are actually good and some are just absolutely terrible. All right. Thank you for being here. [Audience member calls out "We love you, President Trump."]


Donald Trump 00:06:10-00:06:38 (28 sec)
?
It shows that ratings are more important than hatred. I've always said that. As your president, I will fight for you every
single day, with every breath in my body. I will fight, fight like hell. Together, we will save this country, we will defeat the corrupt system in Washington, and America's future will be an absolutely incredible one.


Donald Trump 00:06:38-00:06:59 (21 sec)
?
That's what it is. But we got to start immediately. It can't wait any longer. It's not going to be possible. This is all you
really need to know. It's simple, not particularly beautiful as a statement, but very simple. It's Kamala broke it, I will fix it. [Audience chants "USA"] Thank you. And I don't know if you know, but Kamala has a little rally going on.


Donald Trump 00:06:59-00:07:16 (17 sec)
?
And when I say little, I mean little. [Audience boos] It's a competing rally. It's not this giant place that's sold out. What --
what a beautiful -- this is a beautiful place. But -- and it's quite embarrassing. It's all over the internet. She's screaming, and the people, it's about 100 people, they're not moving.


Donald Trump 00:07:16-00:07:40 (24 sec)
?
They just -- they just want to go home, just because be going. It's not quite this. You see the front row, you have a lot of	X
front-row joes. We have more front-row joes here than she's got at her big rally. This was the big one. No, it's a whole lot. She tried to get stars to come in, and they wouldn't do it, actually.


Donald Trump 00:07:40-00:08:01 (21 sec)
?

She'd go and get Beyonce. [Audience boos] Beyonce would come in. Everyone is expecting a couple of songs, and there were no songs. There was no happiness. It's just like "Give me my check. I want to get out of here." But you always put the star -- she should have learned this from crooked Hillary. Always put the star after you.


Donald Trump 00:08:01-00:08:19 (18 sec)
?
That way, the people stay. Finish your speech, let the star -- and even if she doesn't sing. They booed like hell, but the
press didn't play that. They booed both of them the hell out of the stadium. But you know what, even though the act was terrible, it's, like, by that time, you're out of the -- like Elvis had left the building.


Donald Trump 00:08:19-00:08:53 (34 sec)
?
Elvis has left the building. No, it's terrible. They forgot -- they obviously forgot to get a star tonight. But we don't need a
star. We don't need stars. I never had a star. No. [Audience chants "Trump"] We don't need a star. Just to bring it back into seriousness, we don't need a star because we have policy.


Donald Trump 00:08:53-00:09:18 (25 sec)
?
We have great policy. We have great policy. No, we do have great policy. Look, they have horrible policy. They've got a
machine that's incredible. They've got a vicious, horrible, horrible group of people, a machine where they can have open borders and let people pour into the country. They can have transgender operations at any age anytime you want. [Audience boos]


Donald Trump 00:09:18-00:09:49 (31 sec)
?
They can be pushing men playing in women's sports and -- [Audience boos] and because they have -- because she's
just a vessel and Joe Biden was just a vessel. It's a group of very powerful people that are probably people that hate our country and they want to destroy our country. Somebody said, "Are they dumb? Who would have these --" It's embarrassing when I say, "We will keep men out of women's sports."


Donald Trump 00:09:49-00:10:07 (17 sec)
?
I'm saying -- can you imagine saying that 10 years ago? They'd say, "This guy is cracked up. This guy is crazy. Who the
hell is going to have men playing --" Did you see the Olympic boxing where two people who transitioned, they transitioned from men to women, and just a light jab, that was the end of that one.


Donald Trump 00:10:07-00:10:29 (22 sec)
?
You know, a jab, for those that don't know, but -- that's just like -- it's sort of like a defensive punch. Bing, and the
young lady who was a champion walked back to the corner. She was from Italy, beautiful young lady, which I'm not allowed to say. You can't say beautiful, so I'll take beautiful. But she was a beautiful young -- in politics, you're not allowed to call a woman beautiful anymore.


Donald Trump 00:10:29-00:10:41 (12 sec)
?
It's the end of your career. So, please delete the word beautiful. Thank you very much. Well, "60 Minutes" deleted the
whole damn answer [Audience boos] right? So, I'm allowed to do that, aren't I, Susan Wiles? But America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than ever before. [Audience member calls out "Yeah"] It's true.


Donald Trump 00:10:41-00:10:58 (17 sec)
?	X
Tomorrow, you have to stand up and tell Kamala that you've had enough. You can't take it anymore. She's the least
talented person we've ever seen in government. She allowed our borders to be opened. She has allowed bad things to happen. She allowed a man who was grossly incompetent to remain in the most important position of any country in the world when they're talking nuclear weapons and they're talking wars.


Donald Trump 00:10:58-00:11:42 (44 sec)
?
And she still says, "Oh, no, I didn't notice anything wrong." If she -- if she didn't notice anything wrong, then she's got a
bigger problem than he has. So, we don't like it, Kamala. We don't like what you've done. You're the worst vice president in history. He's the worst president in history. Kamala, you're fired.


Donald Trump 00:11:42-00:12:03 (21 sec)
?
Get out. Get out. You're fired. [Applause] Right? [Audience member calls out "I love you, Trump."] See, I consider all
those guys back there with the big muscles -- and it's not my thing, but I consider them really beautiful to me. They're beautiful people, and they are productive people. They make our country work and run.


Donald Trump 00:12:03-00:12:19 (17 sec)
?
They built our country. They did. And then you had stupid politicians that let them down. And those companies got
taken out of Pittsburgh and every place else like you take candy from a baby. But now, we have the exact opposite. If we win Pennsylvania, we will win the whole thing. [Audience member calls out "Yeah"] It's very simple.


Donald Trump 00:12:19-00:12:42 (23 sec)
?
And I do believe it is -- I say you have to make -- I do believe it is too big to rig. I think it's too big to rig. They'll try, and
they are trying. You know that. It's too big to rig. This is a big movement. This is -- you know, we did great in 2016. We did much better in 2020, but a lot of bad things happened.


Donald Trump 00:12:42-00:12:54 (12 sec)
?
He turned out to be a brilliant candidate from his basement that nobody ever heard. No, this is that big, powerful,
vicious party, though. No, it's a vicious machine. I mean, they can take all these bad ideas and win elections. It's like there's only way you could do that, one way. There's only one way.


Donald Trump 00:12:54-00:13:07 (12 sec)
?
But you know what it did teach us? In one way, it was good because it taught us how bad a communist philosophy is,
how bad a Marxist philosophy [Audience member calls out "Yeah"] how bad all of this stuff is. And we'll really be able to get our country back the way it should be. It's much easier because you're going to realize how bad it is.


Donald Trump 00:13:07-00:13:42 (35 sec)
?
It's just what's -- what's happening when we go over the economy and the economic numbers over the last week. It's
Herbert Hoover stuff, and I never wanted to be Herbert Hoover. Let me just tell you, the one president I didn't -- and there were some that I wouldn't want, too, either, but in particular, because I'm very good at business, I've always been good at business, they're starting to realize that -- those guys back -- oh, they wanted me to be bad, so bad.


Donald Trump 00:13:42-00:14:14 (33 sec)
?
But now, they're saying, "This guy is guy is shit, man. He's made a lot." But -- but listen, so -- and -- and if I'm not good
enough, Elon Musk is good enough because he is working so hard. Elon -- Elon with that rocket, think of that rocket two weeks ago coming down and those engines are blasting. And I said, "Man, a few days ago, it left. It was a beautiful crystal white. Now, it's all like fire blazing."


Donald Trump 00:14:14-00:15:10 (56 sec)	X
?
They know about that. Like it went through a steel furnace, by the way, but that's what it did, 10,000 degrees coming
down at like 20,000 miles an hour. So, think of it, a car is going 90. You're going -- this is like 20,000 miles coming down 22-story building. Then it stops, starts flipping around, starts finding this crazy site in the middle of where the hell -- wherever it was.


Donald Trump 00:15:10-00:15:35 (26 sec)
?
And I told this story, I hope I don't bore you with it, but I had this guy on the phone. I told it at another rally, and I don't
want to bore. Did anybody hear this story? [Audience member calls out "No"] Should I tell it again? It's quick. [Audience responds affirmatively] I hate to tell it again. I hate to double up, but this is sort of -- so I'm talking to this guy, one of the most important people in the nation, in his mind, only in his mind.


Donald Trump 00:15:35-00:16:01 (26 sec)
?
And because I was president and they say, most likely, like about a 96.2 percent chance, but we can't -- look, we can't -
- we can't -- remember -- if you remember 2016, I was given a 3 percent chance of winning. And then I won Florida, and it went to -- think of it. So, she was at 97 and I was at 3. Then she was at -- I won Florida.


Donald Trump 00:16:01-00:16:24 (23 sec)
?
She went down to 92. Then I won Georgia, then I won North Carolina, then I won South Carolina. Then I won -- I went -- I
ran the whole East Coast, and then people started going crazy. Remember the woman with the glasses and that big head of hair? She was screaming. I said to my beautiful wife, "Why is she screaming? We're going to make America great. Why is she screaming?"


Donald Trump 00:16:24-00:16:50 (26 sec)
?
But she was not too happy. I wonder what ever happened to that woman. She became famous. They were going crazy.
Then she had a 55 percent chance. Then it was a 49 percent. They went crazy. But that was something. So, based on what I'm hearing, he's at, right now, 4 percent -- she's at 4 percent. And so, we never want to take anything for granted, but we're really doing well.


Donald Trump 00:16:50-00:17:02 (12 sec)
?
If you vote -- here's a story. We have the ball. It's ours to win. The only thing I ask is that you go out and vote because if
you vote, we're going to win. And -- and believe the fake news when they say this is going to be tight. This is very -- it's really not tight [Audience member calls out "Yeah"] but they want to do that because they want to get ratings.


Donald Trump 00:17:02-00:17:22 (20 sec)
?
They want everybody to watch. But you got to do this. You got to just forget those people because they don't tell the
truth, OK? [Audience boos] Just -- no, no. [Audience boos] Well, actually, I didn't even correct them because I don't -- it's actually better if let everyone think it's going to be tight as hell.


Donald Trump 00:17:22-00:17:44 (22 sec)
?
But whether it is or not, it doesn't matter, you have to go out and we have to swamp them. Everybody has got to vote.
So, over the past four years, Kamala has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted upon its people. She has violated her oath, eradicated our sovereign border -- this is a sovereign border -- unleashed an army of gangs and criminal migrants from prisons and jails, the toughest people there are.


Donald Trump 00:17:44-00:18:12 (28 sec)
?
You know, I was here with a great group. Just the other night, I was -- I was in Penn State territory, and we -- and we had
a packed room. We had a packed -- not room, it was a stadium, the place. You know, I always go -- I always like to say
when I come to the arenas, "How many times could we have sold it out?" In -- in -- if you look at where we were in	X
Wisconsin, Milwaukee, we had a brand-new, gorgeous, big arena.


Donald Trump 00:18:12-00:18:38 (27 sec)
?
We could have sold it out 10 times. I'm telling you, we could have sold out Madison Square Garden five or six times
[Audience member calls out "Yeah"] five or six. And I always view it that way, but we had situations where -- and we put

up videos of the vicious crimes. I don't put them up anymore. You know why? Because the fake news refuses to put them on.


Donald Trump 00:18:38-00:18:57 (19 sec)
?
And I have friends calling me, they love to watch the rallies. They can't get enough of them. And they're going
"President, it's so terrible. You're speaking and then you put up a video on a screen right behind you and the fake news refuses to --" All they have to do -- they refuse -- they don't put it on television.


Donald Trump 00:18:57-00:19:23 (26 sec)
?
They have the thing on -- every one of those stations. And, you know, there's one that doesn't really treat us good, but
people think they do. Nobody can figure that one out. I'm sure. They don't treat me good, but that's OK. But listen, they can't move the television. They can't move. All they have to do is take their camera and go like this, one inch over, one inch up, and you'd be able to see the screens.


Donald Trump 00:19:23-00:19:49 (26 sec)
?
But you can't see them. So, I don't really -- I don't really bother with it anymore. It's -- I mean, it's a terrible thing, a
terrible thing. We have to get them to straighten out because I think without a free and fair press, it's very hard to do what we want to do. It's a very -- it's a very hard thing, very hard thing to do.


Donald Trump 00:19:49-00:20:15 (27 sec)
?
But they're allowing people to come in from insane asylums and mental institutions from all around the world, from
Venezuela to the Congo in Africa. They're stealing our jobs and they're stealing countless American lives. They're killing a lot of people, much more than you're reading about. The day I take office, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins.


Donald Trump 00:20:15-00:20:45 (29 sec)
?
Oh, those Penn State guys. I wanted them to wrestle the migrants. I told -- you know the UFC Dana White? Oh, they --
they killed me on this. I told Dana, "You have to set up your league of champions, unbelievable, best fighters in the world and a migrant league." At the end, I want the migrant to go against the champion, and I think the migrant might actually win.


Donald Trump 00:20:45-00:21:12 (27 sec)
?
That's how nasty some of these guys are. But I don't know. I doubt that. I'll tell you, I felt very comfortable with those big
Penn State wrestlers. Think of that, they won -- I mean, how good is this coach. They won -- in the last 13 years, they won 11 national titles. They won the title this year. And I had them up -- I brought them up in the stage at Penn State.


Donald Trump 00:21:12-00:21:32 (20 sec)
?
I was at Penn State. The place was packed. And I said to them, "Fellas, you may the -- you may be like the only guys in
the country that can beat the hell out of the migrants." It's true. They're the only ones that could beat the migrants in a fight. These are tough people. These are people who've been in jails.


Donald Trump 00:21:32-00:21:57 (25 sec)
?
They're killers. They're murderers. The level -- the level of -- of viciousness is unexcelled, and it's from all over the	X
world, not just from South America. So, we love being there. I was, just two days ago. We love being there. We love seeing these young guys. These guys were great. But they won 11 out of 13 titles, and it's called, Pennsylvania, here we are, right? It's one of those things.


Donald Trump 00:21:57-00:22:24 (27 sec)
?

They're pretty good. But we have to stop because the United States is now an occupied country. We're an occupied -- can you imagine somebody getting up and making a statement, "We are an occupied country?" When you look at what's happening in Aurora, when you look at what's happening in all places, Springfield -- how about Springfield, Ohio? We're an occupied country.


Donald Trump 00:22:24-00:22:50 (26 sec)
?
And, you know, those are just the places you hear about, but they're taking over large sections of the country. In -- in --
yeah, Colorado. Remember Colorado? They're the ones that started to -- the movement -- the governor -- the weak pathetic governor of Colorado. He's a radical leftist, and he's afraid of the people, the gangs from Venezuela.


Donald Trump 00:22:50-00:23:20 (30 sec)
?
He's afraid of them. He's afraid to do anything. He's lost control of the state. But he was the one that wanted to have
Trump taken off the ballot, even though I was leading all of the Democrats, all of the Republicans at the time. I was No. 1. And they went to the United States Supreme Court and got a nine to nothing approval, but -- that Trump has the right to run for president.


Donald Trump 00:23:20-00:23:50 (30 sec)
?
He wanted me off the ballot. And the people in Colorado -- and the people in Colorado -- and you know who is more
angry than the Republicans? The Democrats, the regular, not the politician Democrats. And they showed me with polls where I was leading in a state that normally -- well, of course, you know, they have all mail-in voting, so, you know, you can't count too much on that.


Donald Trump 00:23:50-00:24:07 (17 sec)
?
But if you didn't have -- if God would come down from heaven, if God would come down and be the vote counter just for
one night, he'd only take one second because, you know, God works faster. God works faster, Megyn, than anybody else I can imagine. Yeah. So, we only need God for one second. He'll do the job.


Donald Trump 00:24:07-00:24:27 (20 sec)
?
He'll do the job and he'll be gone. You'd see we'd win a lot of these places. California sends out 38 million ballots. They
send them out all over the place. They come back. Nobody knows what the hell is happening. Some people get eight ballots, some people get five, and some only get two or three. And I went to California.


Donald Trump 00:24:27-00:24:50 (23 sec)
?
We had a rally. We had 107,000 people show up. I said, "There's no way I would lose." And I do well with Hispanics. I just
got -- a poll just came out, I'm at 56 percent with Hispanics compared to this woman who was at 36 percent. How about that? I think the Green Party got more than she did. I love the Green Party, Jill Stein.


Donald Trump 00:24:50-00:25:16 (26 sec)
?
She's may be one of -- I never met her, but she may be one of my favorite politician. But it will soon be -- think of it.
We're an occupied country, but it will soon be an occupied country no longer. It's not going to be an occupied country. November 5, 2024 will be Liberation Day in America. On day one, I will launch the largest deportation program of criminals in the history of our country.

X
Donald Trump 00:25:16-00:25:37 (21 sec)
?
And I don't want to do that. I'm not looking to do that. I don't want to. I think it's terrible to do, but we have no choice.
These are murderers, 13,099, put out by the Border Patrol, who, by the way, two weeks ago, gave me the best endorsement you've ever seen. They said I'm the greatest president in American history.


Donald Trump 00:25:37-00:26:04 (27 sec)
?
And I said, "Does that include George Washington and Abraham Lincoln?" "Yes, sir, it does." When they say that, they're
all in, right? Better than Lincoln or Washington. Who would have thought? I wonder what my parents say up there. Hi, Mom, Dad. I know my mother is up there. My father is a little bit -- it's in dispute.


Donald Trump 00:26:04-00:26:36 (32 sec)
?
He was -- no, he would be up -- he was a strong guy, but he was a good guy. But I will rescue every city and town that
has been invaded and conquered. Can you imagine, we're talking about -- these are military invasions without the uniforms. That's all it is. And we will put the vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them the hell out of our country as fast as we can.


Donald Trump 00:26:36-00:27:08 (32 sec)
?
And to expedite removals of the Tren de Aragua gang and the MS-13 gangs, equally as vicious -- you know, MS-13 took
two beautiful teenage girls walking to school in Long Island. For some reason, they like -- we took them out by the thousands, ICE. She wants to defund ICE. ICE, they're tough as hell and they're also people that love our country.


Donald Trump 00:27:08-00:27:36 (28 sec)
?
They took two young girls, and they sliced them into pieces as they were walking. They sliced them. They didn't shoot
them because that's too quick. They sliced them up and left them dead, two young, beautiful girls walking to school. And ICE did their business. ICE went in and took care of them. But can you imagine? And now, she wants to defund ICE.


Donald Trump 00:27:36-00:28:00 (24 sec)
?
Let's defund ICE. No, these are -- these are rough people. These are bad people. [Audience boos] I will invoke -- and
this is how far we had to go back because, in those days, they didn't play games. I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil.


Donald Trump 00:28:00-00:28:19 (18 sec)
?
And if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail, with no possibility of parole. And I am hereby
calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer. Right? [Audience chants "USA"] And I will ban all sanctuary cities in the United States of America.


Donald Trump 00:28:19-00:28:49 (30 sec)
?
And I am going to immediately do something that nobody has ever heard before and I've wanted to do it for a long time,
but I don't want these guys to do it because they won't do it properly. We will immediately stop the drugs pouring across our border. [Audience member calls out "Yeah"] We lose 300,000 people.


Donald Trump 00:28:49-00:29:16 (27 sec)
?
You don't lose 90. They've been saying 90, 90, 90. We lose 300,000. Everybody in this room knows people that were
devastated, their children mostly, but the parents, too. They -- they die. Fentanyl. They put a piece -- take a pin, put a little tiny -- little tiny piece of fentanyl in the top of that pin, and that can kill five people.


Donald Trump 00:29:16-00:29:38 (22 sec)
?	X
Put a little bit more, it can kill the entire town. This is what we're dealing with. Everybody I know is losing sons, children
to fentanyl. We lose not 100,000. We lose probably much more than 300,000. So, essentially, that's a war, right? That's a war. We don't lose that many soldiers if you're in wars.


?	Donald Trump 00:29:38-00:30:06 (27 sec)

So, we lose 300,000 people a year to drugs entering from Mexico. And if they don't stop this poison from flooding into our country -- and they can stop it by not accepting it from China. And I'm doing the same thing with China. We're going to tariff the hell out of them. And Mexico -- you know, people are surprised to hear this.


Donald Trump 00:30:06-00:30:35 (29 sec)
?
Mexico is our largest trading partner. And if we put even a small tariff on, like 10, 15 percent, you're talking about tens of
billions of dollars, and they're not going to want to have that long. And they're strong. They can stop it if they want. They can do it if they want. They'll probably have to make a deal with the cartels because the cartels totally run Mexico, totally.


Donald Trump 00:30:35-00:31:09 (34 sec)
?
It's a terrible -- terrible things are happening in Mexico. But we're going to put a tariff on Mexico if they don't
immediately stop sending that horrible stuff into this country. And likewise, we're doing it with China. If China doesn't stop -- you know, I had a deal with President Xi. He was going to give the death penalty because, in China, they give the death penalty.


Donald Trump 00:31:09-00:31:58 (49 sec)
?
When I first met -- and I had a great relationship until COVID, until -- I call it the China virus. I'd like to be more accurate.
I had -- I had a great deal and a great relationship with President Xi, really great. He came to Mar-a-Lago. We spent a lot of time. We had -- we had a very good relationship.


Donald Trump 00:31:58-00:32:21 (23 sec)
?
He's a strong man. He's a fierce person. You know, people said, "What's he like?" He's fierce. There's nobody in
Hollywood that could play his role, believe me. And I say that with respect. But I said to him, "You're killing a lot of people by sending fentanyl into our country." I said, "How many people do you lose a year with drugs?" "No, nobody."


Donald Trump 00:32:21-00:32:51 (30 sec)
?
I said, "What do you mean nobody?" "No, no, we have no problem with drugs." "Why?" "We have a quick trial." "What is
a quick trial?" I mean, I know what a quick trial is. "What is a quick trial?" "If we catch a drug dealer, we bring him to a quick trial." He said, "We bring him to a quick trial, and they're almost always found guilty. And then we send the bullet home to the family, and the family must pay us for the bullet."


Donald Trump 00:32:51-00:33:11 (20 sec)
?
Can you believe this? This is a little different than our country. In our country, they'd lawyer up, they'd be going to trial
for 30 years. But they have no drug -- they have zero drug problem. And I said, "I want you to do me -- do me a favor," and we made a deal. "You're killing our people, and that's going to end up in bad things for you, really bad for you, not for -- for you."


Donald Trump 00:33:11-00:33:33 (22 sec)
?
It can't get any worse for us. I said, "I want you to do me a favor. I want you to give the same death penalty to those
people that are sending fentanyl into the United States. And if you don't do that, I'm going to tariff the hell out of your shit coming into the United States." And guess what, he agreed to do it.

X
Donald Trump 00:33:33-00:33:49 (16 sec)
?
It was -- we had an agreement. And then we had a very bad election, a horrible election. Think of the difference, how
different our country would be. You wouldn't have had the fentanyl problem. You really wouldn't. You wouldn't have had inflation because they did that by screwing around with my energy.


Donald Trump 00:33:49-00:34:12 (23 sec)
?
We had energy at $1.84. It was $1.87. It was corrected by the federal government. I was at $1.84. We had all of these
things. You wouldn't have had October 7th in Israel. All those people would be alive today, the hostages that most of whom are no longer living. Think of it. Russia -- Russia would not have -- Russia would not have attacked.


Donald Trump 00:34:12-00:34:27 (15 sec)
?
Ukraine wouldn't have happened. But Israel wouldn't have happened because Iran was broke. I said, "You can't buy any
oil from Iran. Anybody that buys oil from Iran can't deal in the United States. We don't do business with you." China stopped it. I told that to President Xi. "If you buy oil --" They were the primary customer.


Donald Trump 00:34:27-00:34:47 (21 sec)
?
If you buy one barrel of oil, one barrel from Iran, you're not doing any business with the United States. We'll go cold
turkey, which some people like anyway, but -- and you know what, they said, "All right." They didn't. Nobody did. I said that to 45 different countries. They weren't selling anything.


Donald Trump 00:34:47-00:35:15 (27 sec)
?
They were essentially broke. They wanted to make a deal so badly. And then we had that bad election, that horrible,
disgusting -- worst thing that ever happened to the country was that election. And I left, and they didn't follow up the deal that I made, and the fentanyl is now pouring into Mexico at numbers and more people are dying.


Donald Trump 00:35:15-00:35:48 (33 sec)
?
And it comes across this open border. And we're taking in more drugs, human smuggling, all women, setting records.
Poor -- bring up that -- my all-time favorite chart if it's possible to find. Where is that all-time favorite, the -- so the red arrow on the bottom, that's the lowest -- it's done by the Border Patrol, not by me.


Donald Trump 00:35:48-00:36:28 (40 sec)
?
It looks like something done by me, doesn't it? But that was my last day in office. Look at the red arrow. That was the
lowest that we've ever had. Drugs -- it includes drugs, but drugs and human trafficking, but mostly illegals coming into the United States of America. Look at that number. And it would have gone down, all they had to do is leave it alone, leave the people we had, Brandon Judd, all these great people.


Donald Trump 00:36:28-00:36:52 (24 sec)
?
Tom Homan was consulting me and all these great people. That's all they've done in their life, and we had it down to a
science. The drugs were coming in at the slowest rate. But we had illegals almost stopped. By now, they would have been literally stopped. And by the way, we want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.


Donald Trump 00:36:52-00:37:12 (19 sec)
?
They have to come in legally. They have to show they can love our country. They have to show that they didn't murder
seven people along the way. But that's the lowest point. And I love that chart, even it was bad numbers, which is not. But even if it was horrible numbers, I would love that chart so much.


Donald Trump 00:37:12-00:37:36 (25 sec)
?	X
That chart was right over there. It never was over there, and it was never over there because they always do this toward
the end of a speech, not at the beginning. And I looked over there at that chart, and I -- wing. I said, "What the hell was that?" Yeah. So, that was pretty amazing. But you know, I -- I do want to tell you one quick story.


?	Donald Trump 00:37:36-00:38:06 (30 sec)

So, I'm in Detroit, and Mexico is getting rather rough with us in terms of trade, and we're not going to take it. We don't have to take it. We have a good trade deal, but, you know, nobody knows how to use it because they're stupid people. And Mexico -- and Mexico is doing things that aren't good. And, you know, China is using Mexico as a subchapter S corporation, practically.


Donald Trump 00:38:06-00:38:32 (26 sec)
?
China is putting a lot of money into -- you know, they're running the -- they're running things pretty good, and they're
going to build the largest auto plant. I was making a speech at the Detroit Economic Club. About a year and a half ago, it looked like I was going to run and I wanted to go see an auto plant because we're getting screwed on autos.


Donald Trump 00:38:32-00:38:59 (27 sec)
?
I mean, they're -- everyone is moving their plants over. Actually, Elon built a big plant in Texas, OK? We like it. All right?
Elon built a very big plant in Texas. We got to give credit. We love Elon. He gave me -- he gave me another of the greatest -- he -- and you know where he is right now? He's in another part of your state.


Donald Trump 00:38:59-00:39:20 (21 sec)
?
He is now in Pennsylvania campaigning for Donald Trump because he thinks it's the single most important thing.
[Applause] And, you know, he said something to me that -- that was interesting because nobody knows computers. That rocket I was telling you about, the way it laid down, he said it's all computers operating the engines.


Donald Trump 00:39:20-00:39:40 (20 sec)
?
The engines are -- are the easy part. He said the computers -- it's tremendous computerization. The way it just shifted
it over, it's so beautiful. But I said to him, "What do you think about --" Because he really is watching this whole voting process. And he said, "You know, computers are the greatest."


Donald Trump 00:39:40-00:40:02 (22 sec)
?
He looked at some that were just shipped in, some of these vote-counting computers. He knew it before it even came in
the door. He looked like at the back of it. "Oh, I know that one." I mean, he knows that's how -- I mean, he knows this stuff better than any. And he actually said -- and this is for the good of everybody, it's the good of mankind, essentially.


Donald Trump 00:40:02-00:40:23 (21 sec)
?
If you look at France, if you look at all these -- they had their mail-in voting, they all gave it up. That -- nobody does it
like we do. And Gavin Newscum -- look at Gavin Newscum. So, now, not only is voter ID no good. If you're an official and you ask somebody for voter ID, "I'd like to see your voter ID," you have committed a criminal act.


Donald Trump 00:40:23-00:40:39 (16 sec)
?
Do you believe it? The mere asking. He just signed the bill. That's right, Megyn, isn't it? The mere asking. This guy just
signed the bill. And an official says, "I'd like to see your voter ID." He's guilty of a crime. This is crazy. And there's only one reason they want to do that, because they want to cheat.


Donald Trump 00:40:39-00:41:04 (25 sec)
?
But Elon Musk said to me -- I hope I'm allowed to say this. I think I am because, one thing, he's out there. He's a guy --
he just wants the truth. He's an incredible guy. And he said computers aren't meant for this kind of stuff. He said there's	X
only one thing you can do. He's the most sophisticated guy in the world when it comes to computerization.


Donald Trump 00:41:04-00:41:23 (19 sec)
?
He said the only thing you can do is paper ballots, same-day voting. You know, paper is very sophisticated,
watermarked. It's very sophisticated. Paper ballots, voter ID, one-day voting, not 10 days where you say, "Oh, let's --

let's move these boxes from that room to this room because we're going to fix the air conditioning."


Donald Trump 00:41:23-00:41:43 (20 sec)
?
And then the boxes never get put back, and you say, "What happened to those boxes?" Oh, no, one-day voting, he said.
And he said also proof of citizenship. You know, it would be nice. Very simple. And you'll have your answer as to who won and who lost by 10 o'clock in the evening. Nobody is going to dispute.


Donald Trump 00:41:43-00:42:09 (26 sec)
?
France had it, 37 million votes, and we knew who won and who lost at 9:30 in the evening. That's the time that they set.
Do you know that I'm hearing that stories that they may take 12 days extra to count the ballots? [Audience boos] And bad things happen when you do that. Although, today, we won a very good case in Georgia, where the judge ruled that no, they're not allowed to have unlimited extensions for the votes to come in.


Donald Trump 00:42:09-00:42:30 (21 sec)
?
That's what I was -- "We have unlimited extensions." "Oh, oh, oh, we just found 100,000 votes just poured in from the --
" No, we got to straighten out our -- you know, it won't affect me after this. Just we have to do it. We have to win the old-fashioned way and then fix it. But we have to fix it. We can't allow this to happen.


Donald Trump 00:42:30-00:42:47 (17 sec)
?
And remember, the states are essentially an agent, if I can use that term. But they're an agent of the federal
government. The states are doing the collecting, so to speak, and they have to take their orders from the federal government. And how can you do this where they say it's going to take days longer? You have all this equipment.


Donald Trump 00:42:47-00:43:03 (16 sec)
?
The other thing is if you go to a paper system, it'll cost you 8 percent of what all of this fancy machinery costs. But Elon
said that there is no computer in the world that can't be broken into very easily by somebody that's computer smart. I have a son at home, Barron. I said -- people love Barron.


Donald Trump 00:43:03-00:43:26 (23 sec)
?
They love Barron. They love Barron. I say, "Barron, you're always on your computer." I think you have to learn it at a
young age, actually. "Barron, you're always on your computer. You got to stop. You got to do other things." "Yes, Dad. Yes, Dad. Sure. Sure, Dad." "Don't be wise. Look, I'm going to turn this thing off."


Donald Trump 00:43:26-00:43:58 (32 sec)
?
OK, Dad. Try it. So, I turn it off and I turn it off, it's locked. It's done. I have a number on it. He calls me 45. "Come here,
Dad. Take a look." No, these kids are genius, I'm telling you. He's a wise guy, smart one. And do I have good kids? I have to just -- are my kids here? Where are my kids? They're around here.


Donald Trump 00:43:58-00:44:14 (16 sec)
?
They're around here. Get them out here. I think I want to bring them up. Four years -- [Applause] Because they've been
with us, and Barron is home and he's watching this. He is watching. He's a little young. He's -- [Audience member calls out "We love you, Barron."] He's watching. They love Baron. They love -- we love Barron.

X
Donald Trump 00:44:14-00:44:30 (16 sec)
?
And Ivanka is great. She watches. She loves this whole thing. She loves it. She loves you. She loves it. She loves the
whole thing. But I just thought, you know, it's sad because we've been doing this for nine years. We've had hundreds of rallies, hundreds, actually numbers that are not even conceivable.


Donald Trump 00:44:30-00:44:51 (21 sec)
?
I've heard 800, 900. I don't know. But we don't even count them. But we -- and they're all like this. They're all these
magnificent, magnificent rallies. And this is the last one I'm going to have here. And I have one left, the whole thing. And remember, the rallies are the most exciting thing. They'll never be rallies like this.


Donald Trump 00:44:51-00:45:15 (24 sec)
?
You know, you're going to have some leading candidate come in in four years. And honestly, if they're successful, they'll
have 300 or 400 people in a ballroom someplace. This -- this is never going to happen again. It happens every single time. And it's never happened in the world. It's never -- there's never been.


Donald Trump 00:45:15-00:45:51 (36 sec)
?
This is a movement that's never happened, and it's going to be a movement that's going to save our country. It's going
to be a movement that's going to save -- but it's sad in terms of we'll never have this, but we'll have other get- togethers. And in a way, all what we're doing, all these years of work -- and, you know, we started off with that very bad situation four years ago, and it was so -- it was so sickening to wait four years.


Donald Trump 00:45:51-00:46:58 (67 sec)
?
And if I didn't do so well, that's -- I did so much better the second time than the first. I wouldn't have done this if I -- you
know, if I took in less votes. We took in close to 12 million more votes. I mean, Obama -- Barack Hussein Obama, he didn't do that. He got far less votes the second time, and he won.


Donald Trump 00:46:58-00:47:13 (15 sec)
?
And he's a major divider. I watched him the other night. I mean, he's a very divisive guy. I've always said that. He is a
very divisive guy. And his wife, what's -- I've always been so nice. Oh, she was hitting me. She was hitting me. Michelle, she was hitting me. That wasn't nice. I've always been nice.


Donald Trump 00:47:13-00:47:44 (31 sec)
?
But they're dividers, I'll tell you right now. We're not going to stand -- dividers are no good. He's a highly overrated man,
I'm telling you that. But he's a divider. I watched him with his crap where he's trying to get her in. He's the one that pushed her in the first place. And look what happens. I mean, I hope it happens because if it doesn't happen, this country is in big trouble.


Donald Trump 00:47:44-00:48:14 (30 sec)
?
But we've been doing this now for nine years. But -- and we had a great first term. We rebuilt our military. We cut taxes
more than any president in history, including Ronald Reagan, who did a big tax cut. We cut more regulations. We developed and opened Space Force through the Congress, and I think that's going to go down -- first time in 82 years, that that last one was the Air Force.


Donald Trump 00:48:14-00:48:36 (22 sec)
?
We did that. I mean, think of all the different things that we did. We were respected all over the world. China respected
us. Everybody respected us. There was no laughing at your leader. There was -- they came up with all these hoaxes, Adam Schiff and all this scum that we have in this country. They're scum.
X
Donald Trump 00:48:36-00:49:04 (28 sec)
?
And they knew it was a hoax. And they tried to put this guy who didn't know anything about Russia, they tried to put him
in jail. Adam Schiff conceived of the story. [Audience boos] Think of it. Adam Shifty Schiff, one of the truly unattractive people. I call him Watermelon Head. He's got the largest head and the smallest neck.


Donald Trump 00:49:04-00:49:21 (17 sec)
?
He's got a neck that's about four inches around. He's got a watermelon on top of it. But he's not a stupid person, but
he's an evil kind of person. And he's likely going to be a senator, unfortunately. But I mean, this -- [Audience boos] this scum is going to be a senator, so their movement carries on.


Donald Trump 00:49:21-00:49:46 (25 sec)
?
But our movement carries on, too. As long as ours carries on. No, he's got the smallest neck I've ever seen. Do you think
he can play football for the Pittsburgh Steelers? [Audience responds "No"] I don't think so. One shot, and there goes, the whole thing would fall apart, one little shot. One tiny tap like that, boom, falls off.


Donald Trump 00:49:46-00:50:08 (22 sec)
?
No, but bad -- but think of how bad this is. I don't want to put him on the spot, but this kid went through hell on a story
that they knew was made up, Russia, Russia, Russia, hoax. And I saw a Schiff come out of an intelligence meeting or something. You're not supposed to even do this, but he goes out in this press and he says, "Donald Trump Jr. will go to jail for what he's done with Russia."


Donald Trump 00:50:08-00:50:31 (24 sec)
?
[Audience boos] Right? And -- and I said, "Whoa." I said, "What's this all about?" So, I called him up and I said, "Don,
what's going on?" He said, "Dad, I don't know anything about Russia." He didn't do anything. He went before grand juries. He went before -- what they did to this guy was -- and you know what, I think he became tougher because of it, maybe too tough.


Donald Trump 00:50:31-00:50:54 (22 sec)
?
He maybe got -- I think he's too tough, Sarah. I don't like it. He's too tough. They've made my son too tough, Mike. But
he's a great guy and he's a -- he's a good person, and they put him through hell. But think of it, what person -- and Hillary was in on the act. They spied on my campaign. It's now proven, they spied on my campaign.


Donald Trump 00:50:54-00:51:17 (23 sec)
?
The Russia, Russia, Russia thing with Mueller, you saw Mueller's performance in Congress, right? He didn't know
anything. We were totally exonerated. But for two years, this guy went through hell. He went through hell. He had nothing to do with Russia. He didn't know anything about it. They went through millions of phone calls.


Donald Trump 00:51:17-00:51:41 (24 sec)
?
They didn't find one phone call to Russia. It was a hoax. But think about how bad you have to be. We're going to put the
son of the president of the United States in prison for what he's done with Russia. And he knows it was a hoax because he conceived of the hoax, along with crooked Hillary and the rest of them and Obama -- and Obama, in my opinion.


Donald Trump 00:51:41-00:52:16 (35 sec)
?
No, but think of it. He conceived of a hoax and he wants my son to go to prison. That is human scum, I'm sorry. And he'll
probably go on to be a senator, and that's OK because we have blocked them. Everything we've done, we've won against, but they are bad people. You know, if they put their genius toward making our country great, boy, would we have fun? We would have fun together.
X
Donald Trump 00:52:16-00:52:34 (18 sec)
?
But I don't know if they're capable of doing that. It'd be great if we could bring everybody together. The time we came
together is just previous to COVID. We had the most successful country ever in history. We were doubling up on China. They were paying us billions of dollars. No other president took in anything.


Donald Trump 00:52:34-00:52:55 (21 sec)
?
And you know what was happening? Everybody had jobs: African American, Asian American, everybody, Asian, the
Hispanics. Look at me with Hispanics. Hispanics, they remember that period four years, five years ago. But everybody was successful: men, women, people that went to MIT, Harvard, and Wharton, and people that didn't have a degree.


Donald Trump 00:52:55-00:53:14 (19 sec)
?
Everybody was doing better than they've ever done before. People that never graduated from high school. And I'll tell
you, what was happening is I was getting calls from people that I would say are the radical left, but people that were definitely very far left, and people wanted to start meeting. There was a whole thing.


Donald Trump 00:53:14-00:53:50 (37 sec)
?
This country was coming together, and then we had -- we got hit with something that nobody knew what the hell it was,
although I did say it was from the Wuhan lab. I was right about that. And bad things happened. And we actually did a great job. Never got the credit for that. We got the credit for what we did with the economy, for what we did -- we rebuilt the entire US military and we knocked the hell out of ISIS.


Donald Trump 00:53:50-00:54:10 (20 sec)
?
It took them -- they were fighting ISIS for 18 years. I -- it took me four weeks to get rid of them, four weeks. So -- four
weeks to get rid of them. But I will tell you, the -- and I just say this because so many people say, "Is there any way to unify the country?" And I used to sort of say, "No, look, we want to have walls, we want to have borders, and they don't."


Donald Trump 00:54:10-00:54:35 (25 sec)
?
I think it has to just be explained. I think that's an easy one. They want the men in women's sports things. You know, I've
been a politician for now -- I can't believe I say that -- but nine years. I've -- I've had a lot of people come up and say, "Well, what about taxes?" What about this? What -- nobody has ever said, "Sir, it's really important to allow men to play in women's sports."


Donald Trump 00:54:35-00:54:54 (19 sec)
?
I've never had anybody say it. Nobody has come up to me and said, "You know, in the transgender thing, sir, it's very
important to my family that you get that." I mean, these things are crazy. And yet, on television, that's all they talk about. That's all they talk about. But we're going to turn this country.


Donald Trump 00:54:54-00:55:11 (17 sec)
?
The -- the bottom line is it was really starting to come together, then we got hit, we got to fix that. Think of it. And when I
turned it back over, the stock market was higher than it was just previous to COVID coming in. Think of that. Amazing. We gave them -- we handed them something beautiful, and they blew it.


Donald Trump 00:55:11-00:55:30 (19 sec)
?
They blew it right out the window. It's terrible. They blew it. And now, we're going to end up in a depression, frankly, if
you look at the numbers that we are going to present in a second. But I just want to thank my kids because they are great kids and they have been with me from the beginning. [Applause] They've been with me right from the beginning. [Audience chants "Trump"]
X

Donald Trump 00:55:30-00:56:01 (31 sec)
?
And I thought I should do that because we go to Michigan tonight and we do one final. We've done -- we'll do four
tonight. But we go to Michigan, and I really thought I should recognize my children. So, this is the second to last one. That's sad because we've been together. I mean, look at these people, the front-row joes, the North Carolina women, the whole thing.


Donald Trump 00:56:01-00:56:18 (17 sec)
?
We have people that have come to hundreds of the rallies, and we all love it. And, you know, they all love the country,
everyone that -- they don't come to our rallies if they don't love the country just because they wouldn't do. But they have -- they have -- but -- but here's the only thing in closing.


Donald Trump 00:56:18-00:56:53 (35 sec)
?
We have done these rallies, and they were only done for one purpose: to put us in a position that we can be put in
tomorrow to fix our country because the rallies, otherwise, they're just nice entertainment. So, all of these rallies that we've had for years now, they're done to put us -- and, you know, after that last horrible situation and so many bad things happened, China was immediately allowed to go buy oil, and Iran has hundreds of billions of dollars now.


Donald Trump 00:56:53-00:57:34 (41 sec)
?
They had nothing. They were broke. And so many other things happened, and it's really sad. But we were put in a
position with these rallies where -- I can't tell you yet. But I mean, we're certainly on the two- or three-yard line, and the only way we can blow it is if you blow it. I've given you the ball.


Donald Trump 00:57:34-00:57:53 (18 sec)
?
I mean, you got to go and vote. You got to vote. And if they vote, Susie, right, if they vote, it's over. And they know it.
They know it. They know it. They've already pulled out of a couple of states. You know, states -- states like -- the word is they pulled out of North Carolina. They cut all their ads.


Donald Trump 00:57:53-00:58:11 (18 sec)
?
They're using the money someplace else. I even heard they ran out of money. They don't have any money with all the
money they raised. And they get a lot of it from unions and this and that. Even though -- some of the guys were telling me -- the steelworkers, they say, "The steelworkers are with you, just the top guys aren't," because you know what, it's
-- I don't even blame them.


Donald Trump 00:58:11-00:59:00 (49 sec)
?
It's a habit. So many years, 50, 60, 70 years, they support the Democrats like a habit. But they're going to do a lot better
with me. I want to tell you one quick story because it has to do with these people because I want to save their jobs, whether it's autoworkers or steelworkers. So, China -- China -- I have a friend who's the best and the biggest auto factory builder in the world, I guess, very big, very good, very capable guy, John, and I see him and we're talking about a year ago.


Donald Trump 00:59:00-00:59:29 (29 sec)
?
And he said, "Yeah, we're building some big --" "Oh, good. I want to see." "We're building some big auto factories."
"Great. I want to see one. When can we go?" I want to take a look because, you know, I'm thinking about running pretty	X
hard and that's a big thing. We got to save Michigan. We got to save Detroit.


Donald Trump 00:59:29-01:00:00 (31 sec)
?
Detroit's got big problems. And -- but just generally the car industry, right? It's a big industry. We want to be at the top.
So, I want to see one of the factories. "OK. Good. We're going to go down to Mexico." I said, "I don't want to go to

Mexico. I want to look at it --" "No, we don't build the big ones over here."


Donald Trump 01:00:00-01:00:32 (32 sec)
?
What do you mean? He said, "It's just we don't. It just doesn't work that way." So, he said, "As an example, we're
building a really big one in Mexico, right near the border." I said, "Who's the owner or the principal?" He said China. So, China is building a massive auto -- massive. He said it'll produce probably more cars than the state of Michigan produces, when you think, you know, because they have smaller plants.


Donald Trump 01:00:32-01:00:56 (25 sec)
?
They're all over the place. Some of them are very old. I said, "That's bad. That's going to kill Michigan. It's going to kill
Detroit. It's going to hurt South Carolina, Tennessee, and various other places that are involved. That's really bad. This is a big --" "Yeah, and they're going to build more."


Donald Trump 01:00:56-01:01:28 (32 sec)
?
And I thought about it, and about two months ago, I let it be known that I'm going to put tariffs on all the cars that
they're going to be selling us into the United States. And I let it be known that the tariffs would be about 100 percent and 100 percent tariff on any car that's made in these factories in Mexico, probably any car coming in from Mexico.


Donald Trump 01:01:28-01:01:55 (27 sec)
?
Remember, I'm going to put tariffs. This is a big thing. I'm putting tariffs on Mexico if they don't straighten out this drug.
It's their problem. They're coming through Mexico, and Mexico is accepting this fentanyl, and I'm putting tariffs on Mexico. Every damn thing that they sell into the United States is going to have like a 25 percent tariff until they stop drugs from coming in.


Donald Trump 01:01:55-01:02:25 (30 sec)
?
And let me tell you something, those drugs will stop so damn fast that your head will spin. And I'm not playing games.
I'm going to do it. And I'm doing the same thing to China. If they want to sell Mexico fentanyl at levels that nobody -- it's going crazy right now, what they're doing. You know, at least I -- we fought it like hell, and we did relatively successfully.


Donald Trump 01:02:25-01:02:49 (24 sec)
?
You can never -- I mean, they put it in hubcaps of cars. It's tough. It's all over the place. It's genius, some of these
devices they come up with. But I've told China, "You want to sell --" We're going to have a good relationship with China hopefully. I want to have a good relationship. "But you sell fentanyl into the United States through Mexico, we're putting a 25 percent or so tariff on until such time as you stop doing it."


Donald Trump 01:02:49-01:03:08 (19 sec)
?
And they're not going to do it for long because that is a massive penalty. And we don't have to fight -- we don't have to
fight with guns. You know, I had no wars. I stopped wars. I stopped two countries from fighting each other that have nothing to do with us. You can ask Ric Grenell, who did a great job for us.


Donald Trump 01:03:08-01:03:29 (21 sec)
?
And you can ask -- I stopped -- you can ask Mike Pompeo. He's here. I stopped countries from fighting wars that had
nothing to do with us, just say, "Listen, fellas. You've been killing each other for a thousand years. If you keep --" And	X
they both did business with the United States and made money. I said, "If you keep fighting like this, you're killing people."


Donald Trump 01:03:29-01:03:45 (16 sec)
?

Lots of people are dying. That's all I cared about. I didn't care where they're from, but people are dying. Good people are dying because -- because these leaders are stupid. And so, I said, "If you keep doing it, I'm putting a 50 percent tariff on everything that you do business with the United States."


Donald Trump 01:03:45-01:04:13 (29 sec)
?
You got to say -- I'm talking to two countries. They call me up the next day together. "We have -- we have resolved our
differences." It didn't help me, but you know what, I saved a lot of lives. [Applause] So -- so, getting back to the auto plant because, you know, I may be the greatest weaver of all time.


Donald Trump 01:04:13-01:04:31 (18 sec)
?
But what happens, only brilliant people can do that. Stupid people can't do it because they get lost. Where am I?
Where? So, the stories are very boring. They have to go right down like this, right down to the bottom. They can't weave it all. But I can weave and tell you all these stories. And they're all related.


Donald Trump 01:04:31-01:04:53 (23 sec)
?
And in some cases, not too much, 10 percent, but 10 percent is enough. So, getting back to where we started. So, I see,
John. I'm at the Detroit Economic Club last week, had a great -- great people. And I see John sitting in the audience right where that big strong guy is with the label on his jacket, right there, you with a hat on, big powerful guy.


Donald Trump 01:04:53-01:05:18 (25 sec)
?
He's much more powerful physically than John, I can guarantee you that. But I see John sitting right there, and I'm
making a speech. I want to see, John, I want to get this speech over with. I want to find out what the hell is happening with that plant. But I had told everybody that if they build that plant, I'm putting a 100 percent tariff on every car that that stupid plant makes [Audience member calls out "Yeah"] because they're looking to hurt our country.


Donald Trump 01:05:18-01:05:49 (30 sec)
?
And I did that and then sort of forgot about it. But now, I see John, and I say, "Do me a favor. That guy sitting over there,
please bring him backstage after I'm finished speaking." They bring him backstage. I say, "Hi, John. How's that plant going where China is going to spend all that money to build a big plant that's going to hurt the United States and kill its auto industry?" He said, "Sir, I was notified last week that they've given up the plant. They're not going to build it. They think you're going to win. And if you win, they think it's going to be a very bad experience for them. They're going to lose their show."


Donald Trump 01:05:49-01:06:25 (37 sec)
?
And that's what happened. And I stopped it. And those guys back there, I took some pictures with a few of them, and
they were hugging and kissing me. I said, "Get off me." Look at the size of those arms over there. They never kissed a man in their life. And you know why? Because I put tariffs on China dumping steel in the United States and every one of those guys is working now, right? And they're all working now and their steel plants are open.


Donald Trump 01:06:25-01:06:43 (18 sec)
?
And I was just starting. I was just starting. So, they like -- they like Trump. The rank-and-file loves Trump. The other guys
are sort of like there's something strange going on. But I don't care. It doesn't matter. I don't want the other guys. I just
want these guys. I'll tell you, the Teamsters supported Trump, 62 percent, and they have a great leader.	X

Donald Trump 01:06:43-01:07:01 (18 sec)
?
They have a great leader in the Teamsters, right, Steve? Sean O'Brien is a great leader, but he -- he just took a neutral --
and I think that's good, but he took a neutral position. But we had -- they took a vote with the Teamsters, and the Teamsters voted for us. And the firemen voted for us. I mean, everybody is voting for us.


Donald Trump 01:07:01-01:07:23 (21 sec)
?
And I like union. I like nonunion. I like everything, depends where you are. But the unions have been amazing. But the
steel unions, they were all going to go out of business. They -- if I didn't put those tariffs on, there wouldn't be one steel plant in this country open, and that's a business, right? And that's a business we need.


Donald Trump 01:07:23-01:07:43 (21 sec)
?
If we're -- look, I'm going to keep us out of World War III. We're not going to have World War III. But if we ever had -- I
mean, steel is a business you have to have. If we ever had a war -- if we ever had a war, you need steel. War with China. Oh, do you think they'll keep selling us steel? I don't think so.


Donald Trump 01:07:43-01:08:01 (17 sec)
?
We need more steel from China as we attack China. These people are crazy. So, that's one of the reasons I like those
guys. If I -- and it was a big -- it was a 50 percent tariff, and I would have lifted it higher, but they practically stopped. And all these steel mills are open today because of what I did.


Donald Trump 01:08:01-01:08:24 (23 sec)
?
There wouldn't be a steel mill in the country. And these guys didn't have the guts, they would have never had the guts to
do it. So, four years of Kamala have delivered nothing but economic hell for the American workers and the autoworkers, all workers. Her inflation disaster has made life unaffordable and cost families over $30,000 in higher prices.


Donald Trump 01:08:24-01:08:41 (17 sec)
?
We got to get the prices down, and we will. When we bring the energy way down, the prices are going to come down.
It's very simple. It's not that complicated. When they took over energy and they made it like they're going to close up everything, the prices of energy went up, and that drives -- it's so big, energy.


Donald Trump 01:08:41-01:09:01 (21 sec)
?
It's so powerful. And we have more than any other country, but we don't use it. Just days ago, we had the worst jobs
report in modern history with only 12,000 jobs that were created. We used to hearing 250,000 jobs. It wasn't as good as we anticipated. Twelve thousand jobs. That's like Walmart. Think of it.


Donald Trump 01:09:01-01:09:21 (19 sec)
?
A Walmart deals in those numbers. This is a country. But listen to these numbers. Thirty thousand private sector jobs
were killed in a single month, and most of the hiring is done by government jobs, so it's easy. You just tell the government to hire some more people to keep your numbers up, but they're not the jobs you want.


Donald Trump 01:09:21-01:09:47 (26 sec)
?
You want the jobs like the people standing behind me. And listen, and nearly 100,000 manufacturing jobs were wiped
out, and these are government numbers. These are not Trump numbers. This is not Trump. This is government. We get it right off the tabs. They were wiped out, 100 jobs, manufacturing jobs, were lost since the start of this year.


Donald Trump 01:09:47-01:10:18 (31 sec)
?
One hundred and fifty thousand Americans joined the unemployment rolls in October, 150,000. And nearly a quarter of a
million people dropped out of the labor force over a very short period of time. Just think, a few months ago, they had	X
fraudulently claimed -- these people are crooks. They had fraudulently claimed that they had 818,000 jobs created, and it was a fraud.


Donald Trump 01:10:18-01:10:41 (22 sec)
?

And what happened is they wanted it because that was such a big number that it made the jobs picture not look great, frankly, because they're so far down, but it looked -- it looked OK. It wasn't like a story. You know, they had a normal thing. So, they created a fake 818,000 jobs, and they thought they'd be able to get away with it through the election.


Donald Trump 01:10:41-01:11:03 (23 sec)
?
They wanted to get away with it right through the election and then announce a week after the election that they're
going to revise the numbers. How would you like to be me? And that happened. When I heard this, I looked up, I said, "Thank you, God. Thank you very much." Because -- no, how would you like to be me and have a phony -- well, I sort of had that the last time, in all fairness, with all the phony crap.


Donald Trump 01:11:03-01:11:29 (26 sec)
?
But how would you like to be me and let's say I didn't win because the economy looked like it was doing OK, and then
you see that they fraudulently put down almost a million jobs on the rolls, and then they announced that, "We're going to revise the numbers downward." But they also did something else because they just revised past jobs report down by an estimated 112,000 fake jobs.


Donald Trump 01:11:29-01:11:52 (23 sec)
?
So, that's almost a million fake jobs, and the press doesn't want to write about it. [Audience boos] But Megyn Kelly will
write about it and talk about it, and others will, but they have to know about it. Meanwhile, 100 percent of the net jobs created in the United States of America has gone only to migrants.


Donald Trump 01:11:52-01:12:18 (26 sec)
?
Migrants have occupied 100 percent. And these are depression-type numbers, and that's where we're heading. If she's
elected, that's where we're heading. If she's elected -- this is a depression. This is a 1929 -- and there was nothing worse than that. This is a 90 -- this isn't 1990s where it was not good, but fine.


Donald Trump 01:12:18-01:12:42 (24 sec)
?
This is a 1929, where people were jumping off buildings. This is a 1929. And it took 25 years to recover from that mess.
And I always said, I said it before, the one president I don't want to be under any circumstances is Herbert Hoover, and that was done by bad tax policy simultaneously with lifting all sorts of other things.


Donald Trump 01:12:42-01:13:00 (18 sec)
?
It made it impossible for people. A lot of mistakes were made. But it took 20 to 25 years to recover, and I don't want that
happening. And that's going to happen with her. She doesn't have a clue. She doesn't have a clue. And, you know, I just mentioned a name, but a woman who I saw the other night on television just ripped some poor idiot apart.


Donald Trump 01:13:00-01:13:18 (18 sec)
?
Megyn Kelly is here [Audience member calls out "Megyn"] and she's doing -- [Applause] come up. Come up here,
Megyn. She ripped a guy apart.


Megyn Kelly 01:13:18-01:13:19 (2 sec)
?
Thank you. So good to see you.

X
Donald Trump 01:13:19-01:13:20 (1 sec)
?
Have fun.


Megyn Kelly 01:13:20-01:13:40 (19 sec)
?

Hi, everybody. [Applause] Hi. It's great to see you. Can you believe this guy? Can you believe the energy and the stamina on this guy? At his -- I'm ready to go to sleep over there. He's got another rally to go to till tonight. Let me tell you, first of all, one of the reasons why I wanted to come here -- one of the many reasons I wanted to come here.


Megyn Kelly 01:13:40-01:14:01 (22 sec)
?
When I launched my show four years ago, we had Mark Cuban on the program. You know [Audience boos] yeah. You
may have seen he was in the news this week. And he started going on about how bad America's race history was and how ashamed he was of America, and that's why he was at all these protests and he felt it was really important to stand up and speak out about human rights violations.


Megyn Kelly 01:14:01-01:14:37 (36 sec)
?
And then it got awkward when I asked him about all the money he was taking from China. Then he dropped a bunch of
F-bombs, and I thought I really enjoyed this feeling of proving Mark Cuban wrong. And so, here I am at a Trump rally, a strong intelligent woman to prove Mark Cuban wrong again. [Applause] I won't take up much of your time, but I do want to tell you the main reasons I am voting for Donald Trump.


Megyn Kelly 01:14:37-01:14:58 (21 sec)
?
Number one, immigration. He mentioned it and people like Laken Riley. [Audience member calls out "Yeah"] I'll be
thinking about her tomorrow, all day. Twenty-two years old, killed in Georgia, a young nursing student, by an illegal. I'll be thinking about Jocelyn Nungaray, 12 years old, in Texas, murdered by two Venezuelan illegals.


Megyn Kelly 01:14:58-01:15:17 (20 sec)
?
President Trump closed the border. Kamala Harris opened it by choice. It wasn't accidental. She said it would be
humane. That's what she and her boss believed. Tell it to Laken Riley's family. There was nothing humane about it. He closed it, they opened it. It was an intentional choice, and there's no reason not to believe they won't do it again.


Megyn Kelly 01:15:17-01:15:47 (29 sec)
?
The boys should not be in the girls' sports. The boys should not be in the girls' bathrooms. The boys should not be in
the girls' locker rooms. Payton McNabb, a North Carolina sophomore in high school, slammed so hard in the face by a volleyball, hit at her by a boy pretending to be a girl. She suffered traumatic brain injury and permanent paralysis.


Megyn Kelly 01:15:47-01:16:12 (26 sec)
?
Kamala Harris looks at her and says, "Be kind. Suck it up. And that's what's right." [Audience boos] Why do our girls
have to face brain damage in order to be kind to boys who want to invade their sports? And by the way, they are going into the women's prisons. She changed the law in California to make sure the taxpayers would pay for their sex change operations. [Audience boos]


Megyn Kelly 01:16:12-01:16:45 (33 sec)
?
She was not just following the law. She changed the law. President Trump will stop it. [Applause] He got -- he got
mocked by the left for saying he would be a protector of women. He will be a protector of women, and it's why I'm voting for him. He will close the border. He will keep the boys out of girls' sports and where they don't belong.


Megyn Kelly 01:16:45-01:17:22 (37 sec)
?	X
And you know what else? One more thing. He will look out for our boys, too, our forgotten boys and our forgotten men,
guys like you, guys like these guys who've got the calluses on their hands, who work for a living, with the beards and the tats, who maybe have a beer after work and don't want to be judged by people like Oprah and Beyonce, who will never have to face the consequences of her disastrous economic policies.


Megyn Kelly 01:17:22-01:17:49 (27 sec)
?
These guys will. He gets it. President Trump gets it. He will not look at our boys like they're second-class citizens. And
ladies out there who want a bit of girl power in this election, let me tell you something. How can you win when the sons and the husbands and the brothers and the dads you love are losing? It's not a win.


Megyn Kelly 01:17:49-01:18:17 (28 sec)
?
We care, young women and older, about the lives of our children, the safety of our children. And we need not get so
obsessed with what happens when they're in the womb that we forget about taking care of them once we're here and they're here and they're loved. Last point, what I don't want -- what I don't think you want is the left's version of masculinity. [Audience boos]


Megyn Kelly 01:18:17-01:18:37 (20 sec)
?
You see that ad they did about Trump voters trying to encourage women to lie to their husbands so that they could vote
for her instead of Trump. That's their version of what marriage looks like, an overbearing husband who bullies his wife into saying she voted one way, as opposed to an honest open relationship.

Oh, wait, I'm talking about Kamala and Doug. OK. Sorry. Where was that story in the news? Where was that story? I
don't remember a single media person, not one, who sat with him, asked him about the abuse allegations against him by a successful professional attorney who has great details, who has receipts, who has witnesses.


Megyn Kelly 01:19:02-01:19:21 (19 sec)

No one even asked about it. [Audience boos] I'm not into their version of toxic masculinity or new masculinity. I prefer
the old version, them, all of you, and I prefer a president who understands how to be strong and how to fight. I hope all of you do what I did last week: vote Trump and get 10 friends to vote Trump, too. [Applause] [Audience chants "USA"]

Unbelievable. Thank you. Wow. Wow. Oh, wow. I have some more big news, Megyn. I'm just getting this right now. So, somebody that's very, very respected asked me to do his show two weeks ago, and I said why not. And to me, it's very big because he's the biggest there is, I guess, in that world, by far.


Donald Trump 01:19:55-01:20:28 (33 sec)
?
Somebody said the biggest beyond anybody in a long time. And his name is Joe Rogan, and he's never done this before.
And it just came over the wires that Joe Rogan just endorsed me. Isn't that great? [Applause] Thank you, Joe. That's so nice. And he doesn't do that. He doesn't do that. So -- and he tends to be a little bit more liberal than some of the people in this room.


Donald Trump 01:20:28-01:21:07 (39 sec)
?
No, I had a lot of -- a lot of fun, and he was amazing, and he was -- it was a three-hour interview. In fact, I was two hours
late for a rally that we had. I had to explain that a little bit. And it was cold out that night. We flew, and I -- but we had to make it. We were two -- more than two hours late, and they understood.

X
Donald Trump 01:21:07-01:21:44 (37 sec)
?
I said, "You know, I -- I just -- was interviewed by a very interesting guy and he just kept going on and take all the long
form. And it could have gone a lot longer. But he was great. And he's not a person that does endorsements, but he did an endorsement. So, I just want to thank Joe Rogan. That's fantastic.


Donald Trump 01:21:44-01:22:04 (20 sec)
?
And, Megyn, thank you very much. That was something. That's really something. Also with us tonight is the man that I
hope is going to be your next senator. He's a winner. He's tough, he's smart, he loves your state, he loves your commonwealth, and he will take this commonwealth to new -- to new heights.


Donald Trump 01:22:04-01:22:24 (20 sec)
?
He's -- he's just a spectacular guy. Dave McCormick. And, Dave, I think -- stand up, Dave. I think you -- I looked at a poll
before, and I think you're doing very well. He's against a survivor. The guy is a survivor. He's a lousy senator, doesn't do a thing. Do you think he's talking about fracking? That guy talks about fracking.


Donald Trump 01:22:24-01:22:46 (22 sec)
?
He's not letting fracking get disturbed in any way, shape. We'll double up the fracking and the jobs and everything else.
She's -- she's totally against. But everything in his life he's done has been successful. He was tremendously successful in college. He was a really good athlete. I don't think he -- I don't know if he was a wrestler, but I think the Penn State guys probably could have taken him.


Donald Trump 01:22:46-01:23:03 (17 sec)
?
What do you think, huh? What do you think? I think maybe, but you never know, right? You never really know. There
could be an upset in the making. But he's been successful at everything. He went to Wall Street and became one of the most important people in Wall Street. And I just want to say that I hope you vote for him.


Donald Trump 01:23:03-01:23:27 (24 sec)
?
He'll be a great -- he's going to be a great, great senator. The commonwealth will be happy. You'll view it as a terrific
vote. And think of it, it's going to be tomorrow. It's going to be tomorrow. We have another man who's a great senator from Tennessee. I love Tennessee. You know why I love him? For a lot of reasons, but we won by 31 percent the last time.


Donald Trump 01:23:27-01:23:44 (17 sec)
?
We didn't have to do this late-night stuff with Pennsylvania. But I think, Pennsylvania, we're going to -- I think we're
going to have a big number in Pennsylvania, too. But I want to thank you, Senator. Bill Hagerty, please. Thank you, Senator. Good-looking senator, too. There's something about that.


Donald Trump 01:23:44-01:24:04 (20 sec)
?
And you have tremendous -- we have so many celebrities here. It's incredible. But, Bill, thank you very much. Good.
Mike Pompeo, please stand up. Mike. He lost all that weight, he's so thin now. He looks good. Thank you, Mike. I appreciate it very much. And we have members of Congress that are warriors.


Donald Trump 01:24:04-01:24:32 (28 sec)
?
These guys have been fighting with me, meaning fighting with me in the proper way, not the bad way, and they're
incredible people. John Joyce, Mike Kelly, GT Thompson, Guy Reschenthaler. These are terrific people. And somebody told me that, Guy, you were a terrific wrestler. Is that true? I didn't -- I didn't hear that.


Donald Trump 01:24:32-01:25:03 (31 sec)	X
?
So, I'm never -- I'm never going to fight him. That's all. You know, when you hear that stuff, don't ever -- don't ever go
against the odds, right? That's fantastic. I heard really -- I mean, like really good. Thank you very much, Guy. I appreciate it. Former congresswoman and Democratic -- and she was a good candidate, too, for president of the United States, Tulsi Gabbard, a woman of great common sense, a woman of great common sense.


Donald Trump 01:25:03-01:25:24 (21 sec)
?
And she just switched over to the Republican Party, so that's good. She was a Democrat, then she became an
independent, and then she became -- thank you very much. It's a great honor. She's a fantastic person. I always said -- you know, I've watched her for a long time, and I'd say, "That's a woman of great common sense," because it's all about common sense.


Donald Trump 01:25:24-01:25:48 (24 sec)
?
We can say conservative. It's common sense. And thank you very much. I appreciate it. A woman that we're very proud
of. She started with us in the Oval Office in the White House. She became press secretary, and she then became the governor of Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Sarah, thank you. Beautiful.


Donald Trump 01:25:48-01:26:06 (18 sec)
?
Thank you. She's doing a good job, too. Oh, we have so many great people. So, somebody that ran for president, and let
me tell you, he was good, he was smart, he was so impressive to me, and he was -- I watched the whole thing go on. They said, "Should you run --" I said, "Listen, I got a 72-point lead over everybody."


Donald Trump 01:26:06-01:26:29 (23 sec)
?
People want to hire a smart person, not a smart -- to be president. When you're leading by 70 or 72 points, why should
you go on a debate and have 12 people knock the hell out of you because, eventually, it's got to have a little impact. So, I said, "I'll sit out the debates," but I watched the debates, and I watched this man and he was unbelievable, the governor of North Dakota.


Donald Trump 01:26:29-01:26:46 (17 sec)
?
He's become one of the great oil experts. That state is doing unbelievable since he's been governor. And he was like
me, he was a successful businessman. He made a lot of money and he wanted to run and he knew the state. He was in the state, and he ran for governor. He won. He's been one of the best governors in the country, very smart.


Donald Trump 01:26:46-01:27:10 (24 sec)
?
And we got to bring him in because he's not going to be running again. I guess he's term-limited or something, but he's
not. And we're going to find a good place for this guy. We're not going to let him go. Governor Doug Burgum. Thank you, Doug. Thank you very much. And his wife, Kathryn. Kathryn is phenomenal.


Donald Trump 01:27:10-01:27:27 (17 sec)

The son of one of the greatest baseball players of all time. Do you think I don't know about Roberto Clemente? Oh. So,
Roberto Clemente Jr. So -- and I hear he's quite a player, also. But I'll tell you, I remember his father. In deep right field -
- I remember the throw. You know, I've seen a lot of baseball, and I've seen a lot of throws.


Donald Trump 01:27:27-01:27:50 (23 sec)
?
And baseball doesn't seem to be quite what it was. We got to do something about that, you know. Too many stations,
too many games, too late at night. They should hire me as commissioner, although I like their commissioner. I do. Some commissioners, I don't like. [Audience member calls out "Make baseball great again"] But you know -- make baseball great. [Audience member calls out "Yeah"]

Donald Trump 01:27:50-01:28:35 (45 sec)
?
But I saw -- come up here for a second, wherever you may be. Where is this guy? Because this guy was like -- come up
here. Come on up here. Anybody with that gene, anybody with a blood in him of Roberto Clemente. Puerto Rico. I love Puerto Rico. Come on. Come here. Tell them how great was your father.


Roberto Clemente, Jr. 01:28:35-01:28:37 (2 sec)

Thank you.


Donald Trump 01:28:37-01:28:37 (1 sec)

Let's [Inaudible] please. [Applause]


Roberto Clemente, Jr. 01:28:37-01:28:54 (16 sec)
?
Hello, Pittsburgh. Well, one thing that I can say is that I'm very proud to be here. For the first time, I had to take a step
forward. It is very important for me to support this man because I believe tomorrow is the change of time.


Donald Trump 01:28:54-01:28:59 (5 sec)
?
Thank you.


Roberto Clemente, Jr. 01:28:59-01:29:31 (33 sec)
?
And to be -- to answer your question to -- to be able to talk about my father, my father, the name Clemente, what it
means is goodwill and unity. I believe that your team is going to bring it all home. I believe in everything that you stand for right now, being able to make the change for our families, my three kids that are very young, and we live here in Pennsylvania.


Roberto Clemente, Jr. 01:29:31-01:29:41 (10 sec)
?
And I told this man that I commit myself to helping RFK Jr. --


Donald Trump 01:29:41-01:29:42 ( sec)
?
Good.


Roberto Clemente, Jr. 01:29:42-01:29:44 (2 sec)
?
With -- with -- with our kids in making America healthy again.


Donald Trump 01:29:44-01:30:13 (30 sec)
?
[Inaudible] Wow. Oh, wow. Well, Bobby is going to like that. Bobby is great, by the way. He's going to work and he's
going to work with -- but now, he's going to work with Roberto Jr. Bobby Kennedy, you know, he's an incredible guy. It's not an easy step. You know, they've been Democrats a long time, the Kennedy family.


Donald Trump 01:30:13-01:30:38 (25 sec)
?
I'm sure they were thrilled. But Bobby had to do the right thing, and he did. And he's going to be very much involved.
You know, he's got a tremendous view on health and pesticides and all the stuff. And we're not really a healthy country. You look at -- some countries are much healthier than our -- than we are, and they don't use all of this stuff.


Donald Trump 01:30:38-01:31:02 (24 sec)
?
And so, Bobby's going to pretty much do what he wants. I want him to do something really important for our country,
makes people healthier. We have obesity, we have every problem you can have, and Bobby feels very strongly about it. And he's going to be very much -- the only thing I told him, though, "Bobby, you got to do one thing. Do whatever you
X
want. You just go ahead. Work on the pesticides. Work on making women's health --"


Donald Trump 01:31:02-01:31:28 (26 sec)
?
He's so into women's health. And, you know, he's really unbelievable. It's such a passion. But I said, "Bobby, I want you
to do it, but leave the liquid gold to me. Don't -- don't trample that. Don't trample on our liquid gold because we're going

to let -- we have more than any other country in the world by far. Don't trample on that, Bobby. Let me just say just close your eyes. Let me just make our country rich as hell."


Donald Trump 01:31:28-01:31:55 (27 sec)
?
So, I got to keep him away from that. That could be a problem, but I got to keep him away from that. But that's -- so
that's so exciting with -- with Megyn and Joe. That's so exciting. I mean, we have so many great endorsements. It's -- it's just really amazing. [Applause] And by the way, Roberto Clemente, you know, we all see a lot of plays and you -- you forget about them.


Donald Trump 01:31:55-01:32:15 (20 sec)
?
Even for those of us that have very good memories, you forget them, you forget them. But I remember playing the Mets,
the poor Mets. They were playing the Mets, and a ball was hit into the corner right field. He played right field. And he went over, a rocket was hit there, and he went over and he got there.


Donald Trump 01:32:15-01:32:37 (22 sec)
?
He was deep in the corner of right field, and the players started marching to the plate, pretty fast runner. And I've never
seen -- and I remember sort of everything. And Roberto Clemente -- because he was a great hitter and all. You think of him as a hitter, but he was an incredible fielder. But he had the best arm, I think, in baseball.


Donald Trump 01:32:37-01:32:57 (21 sec)
?
He threw from the deep corner of right field. It was not possible to do this. A ball that never was more than 10 feet off
the ground. A strike, and the runner was out. And I said, "Well, there go my aspirations about being a professional baseball player." It was the greatest throw I've ever seen to this day.


Donald Trump 01:32:57-01:33:13 (16 sec)
?
And so, I wanted to -- it's funny. I -- he was one of the greatest hitters, but I remember him more for the throw than the
hitting even. So, it's an honor, and Bobby is going to be thrilled, and I've heard so many great things about you, Roberto. We're going to get you lined up, OK? I love that. Thank you very much.


Donald Trump 01:33:13-01:33:36 (22 sec)
?
That's a great honor. Also, Mayor JD Longo is here and Sean Parnell. Thank you, Sean. Thank you. Thank you, Mayor.
Good job you're doing. Good job you're doing. And a couple of friends of mine are here, Steve Witkoff, who has given so much money to North Carolina and all -- any place that has trouble, this guy, I always bring him with me.


Donald Trump 01:33:36-01:34:01 (25 sec)
?
You know why? Because if there's a trouble, he opens his -- he made a lot of money and he loves giving it away to
people and places that have trouble. He's an amazing guy, actually. And he opened his wallet to North Carolina, to Georgia, to a woman last night, Carmen, who lost her daughter to a migrant five days ago and he felt very badly.


Donald Trump 01:34:01-01:34:28 (27 sec)
?
He just helps people. He likes to help people. He's a great businessman, but he loves giving the money away. Thank you
very much, Steve. Stand up. Thanks. Steve Witkoff. And another man who is with us tonight, Howard Lutnick. He's
working on transition with Linda McMahon, a phenomenal woman. And he rebuilt Cantor Fitzgerald.	X


Donald Trump 01:34:28-01:34:46 (19 sec)
?
His whole firm was taken down in the World Trade Center catastrophe. The plane flew right into him, practically. He had
the top three floor. Cantor Fitzgerald, one of the most successful firms on Wall Street. And he was riding down the road of West Side Highway, and he actually saw this happen. He said, "Oh, my God."


Donald Trump 01:34:46-01:35:43 (56 sec)
?
He saw it happen. He saw the plane go in. And you know why he wasn't there? He was always there at 6 o'clock in the
morning. But for five years, his wife was saying, "Will you please take our child to school?" And he said, "No, I can't do it. I've got to be at the office at 6 o'clock in the morning." The one day he agreed to take his beautiful child to school, he was delayed for two hours getting down there because he's taken this kid, who turned out to be great, because a long time ago, I said, "When you look at -- when you look at that beautiful person that you produced, do you thank that person? Do you think that person every single day?" But he wasn't in the -- probably the only day -- it might -- it might have been the only day in your life that you weren't in that building at 6 o'clock in the morning, right? But his brother was in the building and hundreds of other people that worked for him.


Donald Trump 01:35:43-01:36:05 (22 sec)
?
And his firm -- outside of a few people in Europe, his firm was wiped out in one instant. One second, it was wiped out.
They were actually making phone calls to their families saying, "We're stuck. We can't get out." All the fire exits were wiped out and the stairs were wiped out. You couldn't get out.


Donald Trump 01:36:05-01:36:29 (24 sec)
?
They called their wives. They called -- his brother was calling him and the wife. I mean, the whole story is crazy. And
they all died, every one of them, and he had to rebuild. He wanted to rebuild, and he rebuilt the firm bigger, better, and stronger than it ever was. And he gave a big chunk of the firm for an extended period of time to the relatives, wives, and family of the people that were killed.


Donald Trump 01:36:29-01:36:49 (19 sec)
?
Howard Lutnick. [Applause] It's a great story, actually. That's a great story. That's a -- he's a great guy. And just one
other group is here because this is -- you know, we are all-inclusive. And if you see what's going on up in a really incredible place, a part of the country that's very incredible, but it's under -- it's under siege.


Donald Trump 01:36:49-01:37:10 (22 sec)
?
It's under siege. It's happening in Detroit. It's happening in a lot of other places. But Michigan is really under siege
because of what they're doing to the auto business. We'd bring it all back. You'd see that we're going to -- we're going to -- through a series of intelligent tariffs, no taxes, but intelligent tariffs, all those companies are going to be brought back.


Donald Trump 01:37:10-01:37:33 (23 sec)
?
But we've gotten to know and -- and really understand, Muslims for Trump. How about that? Muslims for Trump.
[Audience member calls out "Yeah"] And -- and it has become a big movement in Michigan, a beautiful movement. And you know what they want? They want peace. They really do. They don't want to be in wars.


Donald Trump 01:37:33-01:37:50 (17 sec)
?
They're very smart. And, you know, it started off as a little thing and has grown and grown and grown. And now, we have
a much bigger vote than they do. Can you believe that? Because they said these people are stupid. All they want to do is
-- they didn't know what to do. Actually, they were in between.


Donald Trump 01:37:50-01:38:18 (29 sec)	X
?
And she has no idea. She doesn't know where the hell she is. She can't -- and they liked me, and I like them. And let me
just tell you, they don't want -- they want peace. They don't want a fight. And they're not involved in the terror and all the things that are going on. They're great people, and it's an honor for them -- I don't know where they are, but Muslims for Trump, if you want to stand up, because this was a really great -- thank you very much.


Donald Trump 01:38:18-01:38:38 (19 sec)
?
Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. And I think they'll be -- there's tremendous cohesion, and I think they may very well
be responsible for the kind of numbers we're showing up in Michigan. Michigan is really looking good, just like Pennsylvania is looking good, just like Georgia is looking good, just like Wisconsin is looking good. [Audience member calls out "Yeah"]


Donald Trump 01:38:38-01:39:02 (24 sec)
?
North Carolina is looking really good. Arizona is looking great. Nevada is looking great. Where else is there? But, you
know, even Virginia. We had -- we had a great meeting, Glenn Youngkin. We had a tremendous, tremendous crowd. You know, it's not a swing state, but we had a tremendous crowd in Virginia.


Donald Trump 01:39:02-01:39:23 (22 sec)
?
I'm hearing New Hampshire, we're -- you know, these are states that aren't really in play in theory, but they're in play
now. No, I think we're going to have a big day. But you have to go -- forget about the others. It doesn't matter. You have to go and vote. If we win this state, it's over. We win the commonwealth -- we're going to win the commonwealth of Pennsylvania and it's going to be over.


Donald Trump 01:39:23-01:39:53 (30 sec)
?
So, get out and vote. That's all I ask. In conclusion, with your vote tomorrow, we are going to fire a Kamala, we're going
to save America, we will cut your taxes, end inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and bring thousands and thousands of factories back to America and back to the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.


Donald Trump 01:39:53-01:40:16 (23 sec)
?
We will build American, we will buy American, and we will hire American. I will end the war in Ukraine. Would have never
happened if I was president. I will stop the chaos in the Middle East, and I will prevent World War III from -- you're very close to World War III. You're very close, and we have people that are not the right people to handle it.


Donald Trump 01:40:16-01:40:34 (18 sec)
?
They are grossly incompetent. We will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources, and
respect that they so dearly deserve. They know what's going on. They know everything. They know the names of the people that are coming into our country. They know everything about them.


Donald Trump 01:40:34-01:40:52 (18 sec)
?
All we have to do is let them do their job. We will strengthen and modernize our military. I rebuilt it. But now, a lot was
given away to Afghanistan. Can you believe they had a parade last week where they paraded our beautiful equipment down the middle of their boulevard? I don't like watching that.


Donald Trump 01:40:52-01:41:16 (25 sec)
?
And we should have never -- we should have never let them have Bagram, the big air base that's a mile -- that's just
literally an hour away from China. We will build a missile defense shield over our country, all made in the USA, and a lot of it made in Pennsylvania. We will rebuild our cities, including our Capitol in Washington, DC, making them safe, clean, and beautiful again.

By the way, I don't like it. I'd rather be here. I want to be right here in Pittsburgh with those big strong men back there.
We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down, and we will never ever surrender. Together, we will fight, fight, fight and win, win, win.

November 5th, tomorrow, will be the most important day in the history of our country. And together, we will make
America powerful again, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America healthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again.
