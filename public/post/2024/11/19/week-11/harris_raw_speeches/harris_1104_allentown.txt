?
We're done with that. We're done. And we're exhausted with it. America is ready for a fresh start. [Audience member
calls out "I love you, Kamala."] I love you, sweetheart. And America is ready for a new way forward, where we see our fellow American not as an enemy but as a neighbor. We are ready. We are ready for a president who understands that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down.


Kamala Harris 00:04:55-00:05:27 (31 sec)
?
It is based on who you lift up. [Applause] And Pennsylvania, you know me. I am not afraid of tough fights, evidently. For
decades, as a prosecutor and the top law enforcement officer of our biggest state, I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners. I won fights against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students.


Kamala Harris 00:05:27-00:05:51 (24 sec)
?
I won fights against predators who abused women and children and seniors and cartels that trafficked in guns and drugs
and human beings. [Audience member calls out " We're not going back."] We're not going back. And it is my pledge to you -- it is my pledge to you, if you give me a chance, to fight on your behalf as president.


Kamala Harris 00:05:51-00:06:41 (50 sec)
?
There is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. [Applause] Nothing in the world. And it is my pledge to you that
when I walk -- with your help, it is my pledge to you that when I walk in the White House, instead of stewing over an enemies list, I will spend every day working on my to-do list on your behalf, full of priorities that are about improving your life, about bringing down the cost of living, about banning corporate price gouging on groceries, about making housing and child care more affordable.


Kamala Harris 00:06:41-00:07:20 (39 sec)
?
My plan will be about cutting taxes for workers and middle-class families and small businesses, lowering health care
costs, including the cost of home care for our seniors, because here's where I'm coming from on this. I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. [Applause]


Kamala Harris 00:07:20-00:08:00 (40 sec)
?
And to those certain individuals who still want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act -- [Audience boos] Trying to take us
back to the days when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions, well, to them, we say, "We are not going back." We are not going back. And we are not going back -- [Audience chants "We're not going back."


Kamala Harris 00:08:00-00:08:30 (30 sec)
?
] We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. And we are not going back because ours is a fight
for the future. Ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. [Applause]


Kamala Harris 00:08:30-00:09:02 (32 sec)
?
And when Congress, with Bob Casey's help, passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of
the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. [Applause] So, Pennsylvania, I'm here to ask for your vote. I am here to ask for your vote. And here is my pledge -- and here is my pledge to you. [Audience member calls out "We love you,
Kamala."]	X

Kamala Harris 00:09:02-00:09:54 (52 sec)
?
As president, I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face. I am not looking
-- I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. And I pledge to you -- [Audience chants "USA"] That's OK. And it is my pledge to you to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make, to listen to

experts, and to listen to people who disagree with me because I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. [Applause]


Kamala Harris 00:09:54-00:10:35 (41 sec)
?
And you know what? By the way, listen, we are fighting for a democracy right now. And we love our democracy, and
democracy can be a bit complicated sometimes, but that's OK. We are fighting for a democracy, which is why I say that I am not going to be a leader who thinks that people who disagree with me should be put in jail, that they are the enemy.


Kamala Harris 00:10:35-00:11:13 (38 sec)
?
I'll give them a seat at the table because that's what real leaders do, and that's what strong leaders do. And it is my
pledge to you to always put country above party and self and to be a president for all Americans. [Applause] So, Allentown, that is my pledge to you. And so, let me ask, who here has a plan to vote? [Applause] Fantastic.


Kamala Harris 00:11:13-00:11:57 (44 sec)
?
That's great. That's great. All right. So, polls are open here in Pennsylvania tomorrow from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Let's get the
word out. Definitely vote. [Audience chants "Vote"] Vote. And let's get the word out. All the leaders here, help get the word out to remind people of the hours the polls are open and to remind folks that they can go to iwillvote.


Kamala Harris 00:11:57-00:12:19 (22 sec)
?
com for all the information that folks may need in terms of when and where to vote and where to drop off their mail
ballots, right, because that's going to be very important. And to all the leaders here, I ask you to please continue to talk to your friends and your family and your neighbors and let them know why you decided to take time out of your busy lives to be here right now and what is at stake in this election.


Kamala Harris 00:12:19-00:12:46 (27 sec)
?
Please share your perspective on why this election is so important and encourage folks to let them know that their
voices must be heard because we -- [Audience member calls out "UAW is in the house."] And UAW is in the house. [Applause] And I am so proud to have your support. Thank you. I'm so proud to have your support.


Kamala Harris 00:12:46-00:13:24 (38 sec)
?
And we need everyone in Pennsylvania to vote because you are going to make the difference in this election. You will.
[Applause] So, here's how I think about things. We are all here together because we love our country, and when you love something, you fight for it. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, of our expression of our love for our country, to then fight for its ideals and to fight to realize the promise of America.


Kamala Harris 00:13:24-00:13:56 (32 sec)
?
And look, I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it. I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights
Movement. My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller, and there were people there -- we've all read and know about it. There were people there from all walks of life, who came together in a fight for freedom and for opportunity.


Kamala Harris 00:13:56-00:14:37 (42 sec)
?
You know, growing up, I watched my mother as she raised my sister and me and gave us the same chances our country	X
gave her. I was blessed to have family by blood and to have family by love, who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith. I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out but who never stopped believing in that in our country, anything is possible.


Kamala Harris 00:14:37-00:15:11 (34 sec)
?

I have lived the promise of America, and today, I see the promise of America in everyone who is here, in every one of you, in every one of us. We are the promise of America. We, everyone here, we are the promise of America. [Applause] We are the promise of America. And I see it. I see it in the fathers and the mothers and the grandparents who work hard every day for their children's future.


Kamala Harris 00:15:11-00:15:42 (31 sec)
?
I see it in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. I see it in the men who support them.
I see it in the Republicans who never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States over party. And every day, I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time. [Applause]


Kamala Harris 00:15:42-00:16:40 (58 sec)
?
Thank you. Thank you. I love Gen Z. Thank you. Come on. I'm telling you, I love Gen Z, and here's one of the reasons
why. So, here's one of the things about you all. You are rightly impatient for change. I know that. I know that. And you, who have only known the climate crisis, are leading the charge to protect our planet and our future.


Kamala Harris 00:16:40-00:17:15 (34 sec)
?
You, who grew up with active shooter drills, are fighting to keep our schools safe. [Applause] You, who have known --
you, who have known fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers, are standing up for freedom. And for you, none of these issues is theoretical or political. This is your lived experience, and I see you, and I see your power.


Kamala Harris 00:17:15-00:18:02 (48 sec)
?
And we must, must, must recognize how bright the future of our nation is because of you. So, can we hear it for our
first-time voters, everybody? [Applause] There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. All right. OK. One day left. One day left. And we need to finish this strong and get this done.


Kamala Harris 00:18:02-00:18:41 (39 sec)
?
So, let's get out the vote. Let's reach out to all of our folks in the next 24 hours, family and friends and classmates and
neighbors and coworkers. And as we do, I ask, let us please be intentional about building community. Let us be intentional about building coalitions because, you know, there's been so much about these last few years that has been about trying to beat people down, trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other, trying to make people feel as though they're alone and don't have anybody.


Kamala Harris 00:18:41-00:19:02 (20 sec)
?
So, not anymore because we all know -- we all know that our power includes, yes, this vote in this election but building
community and coalitions and reminding folks, the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, and we are all in this together. We are all in this together. [Applause]


Kamala Harris 00:19:02-00:19:43 (42 sec)
?
And from the very start of our campaign, this has not been about a fight that is against something. This is about a fight
that is for something. This is for something. This is about a future with freedom and opportunity and dignity for all Americans. And so, in this final stretch, let us remember that we have a lot of work to do, and there is power in our work about reminding folks of their voice and the power of their vote.

X
Kamala Harris 00:19:43-00:20:34 (51 sec)
?
So, remember, your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power, is your power. [Applause] So, Pennsylvania,
Allentown, I then ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? [Audience responds affirmatively] Do we believe in freedom? [Audience responds affirmatively] Do we believe in opportunity? [Audience responds affirmatively] Do we

believe in the promise of America? [Audience responds affirmatively] And are we ready to fight for it? [Audience responds affirmatively] And when we fight -- [Audience responds "We win."]


Kamala Harris 00:20:34-00:20:44 (9 sec)
?
We win. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
